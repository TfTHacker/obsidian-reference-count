Show the amount of references you have in:
- block references
- headings
- block reference links
- embeds

Click on the number to open a table with links to the note with the reference and the line the reference appears on.

There are settings if you want counts to show up on parents, or children, or both. You can also choose to see a basic table, or a fancier search-like view of references.
